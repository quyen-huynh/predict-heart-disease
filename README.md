# Project: Predicting Heart Disease
My final project for IE 5561 - Analytics and Data-Driven Decision Making. The project aims to predict whether a person has heart disease using several machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, etc., and compare their performances.
